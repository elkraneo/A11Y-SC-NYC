# Competencies
Skillet that helps you use Spatial Computing concepts effectively.

## Overview

Develop essential skills in spatial computing understanding foundational components, leveraging SwiftUI for immersive experiences, knowing collaborative interactions, and ensuring accessibility. Transversal competencies cover designing spatial UI, understanding spatial design principles, crafting intuitive interactions, and optimizing experiences for human vision and motion in visionOS.

### Essential

- [Get started with building apps for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10260) (31:55)

  Get ready to develop apps and games for visionOS! Discover the fundamental building blocks that make up spatial computing — windows, volumes, and spaces — and find out how you can use these elements to build engaging and immersive experiences.

- [Elevate your windowed app for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10110) (15:56)

    Discover how you can bring your multiplatform SwiftUI app to visionOS and the Shared Space. We'll show you how to add the visionOS destination to an existing app and view your app in the Simulator. Explore how your SwiftUI code automatically adapts to support the unique context and presentation of the visionOS platform. Learn how you can update custom views, improve your app's UI, and add features and controls specific to this platform.

### Transversal
- [Create accessible spatial experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023-10034) (25:51)

    Learn how you can make spatial computing apps that work well for everyone. Like all Apple platforms, visionOS is designed for accessibility: We'll share how we've reimagined assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Pointer Control and designed features like Dwell Control to help people interact in the way that works best for them. Learn best practices for vision, motor, cognitive, and hearing accessibility and help everyone enjoy immersive experiences for visionOS.
